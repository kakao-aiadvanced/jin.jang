To solve the problem 23 + 47 step-by-step, follow these instructions:

1. **Identify the numbers to be added**: We have 23 and 47.
2. **Align the numbers by place value**:
   ```
     23
   + 47
   ----
   ```
3. **Add the digits in the ones place**:
    - 3 (from 23) + 7 (from 47) = 10
    - Write down 0 in the ones place and carry over 1 to the tens place.

   ```
     23
   + 47
   ----
     0  (write down 0 and carry over 1)
   ```

4. **Add the digits in the tens place, including the carry**:
    - 2 (from 23) + 4 (from 47) + 1 (carry) = 7

   ```
     23
   + 47
   ----
     70  (final result)
   ```

5. **Combine the results**: The total is written as 70.

Therefore, the answer to 23 + 47 is **70**.

To solve the problem \( 123 - 58 \) step-by-step, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Write the numbers in a vertical format

```
    123
  -  58
```

### Step 2: Align the numbers by place value

Place the numbers so the digits are aligned:

```
    123
  -  58
```

### Step 3: Start subtracting from the rightmost column

1. **Subtract the units place (rightmost)**:
    - Subtract \( 8 \) from \( 3 \).
    - Since \( 3 < 8 \), we need to borrow \( 1 \) from the next column (the tens).
    - This makes \( 3 + 10 = 13 \) (we diminish the tens place by \( 1 \)).
    - Now, \( 13 - 8 = 5 \).

### Step 4: Move to the tens place

2. **Subtract the tens place**:
    - We have now \( 2 - 1 = 1 \) because we borrowed \( 1 \) from \( 2 \).
    - Finally, subtract \( 5 \):
    - \( 1 - 5 \) does not apply here since \( 1 < 5 \); however, we borrowed earlier, so we mean \( 1 - (5 - 1) \).
    - We borrow from hundreds; so we have \( 12 - 5 = 7 \).

Putting it all together, we get:

```
    123
  -  58
  --------
     65
```

### Final Answer

Thus, the answer to \( 123 - 58 \) is \( 65 \).

Let's solve the problem \( 345 + 678 - 123 \) step-by-step.

### Step 1: Add 345 and 678

We will first perform the addition:
\[
345 + 678
\]
To do this, we can line up the numbers:

```
  345
+ 678
------
```

Now, we will add the columns starting from the right.

1. In the units column: \( 5 + 8 = 13 \). Write down 3 and carry over 1.
2. In the tens column: \( 4 + 7 + 1 (carry) = 12 \). Write down 2 and carry over 1.
3. In the hundreds column: \( 3 + 6 + 1 (carry) = 10 \). Write down 0 and carry over 1.

Putting it all together, we get:

```
  345
+ 678
------
 1023
```

### Step 2: Subtract 123 from 1023

Now, we will subtract \( 123 \) from \( 1023 \):
\[
1023 - 123
\]
Again, we can line up the numbers:

```
  1023
-  123
-------
```

Now, we will subtract the columns starting from the right.

1. In the units column: \( 3 - 3 = 0 \).
2. In the tens column: \( 2 - 2 = 0 \).
3. In the hundreds column: \( 0 - 1 \) (since we cannot borrow from a 0, we need to borrow from the thousands column).
   So, \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) (after borrowing, the thousands column decreases to 0).
4. Finally, in the thousands column: \( 0 - 0 = 0 \).

Putting this together, we get:

```
  1023
-  123
-------
   900
```

### Final Answer:

After completing both steps, we find:
\[
345 + 678 - 123 = 900
\]
So the final answer is:
\[
\text{Answer: } 900
\]

# immediate1

To solve the logic puzzle step-by-step, we start by analyzing the clues given:

1. **Alice does not like red.**
2. **Bob does not like blue.**
3. **Carol likes green.**

From these clues, we will deduce each person's favorite color.

**Step 1: Analyze Carol's Favorite Color**

- From clue 3, we know that **Carol likes green**.

**Step 2: Eliminate Possible Colors for Alice**

- Since we know that **Carol’s favorite color is green**, the remaining colors for Alice and Bob are red and blue.
- From clue 1, **Alice does not like red**. Therefore, Alice must like blue.

**Step 3: Determine Bob's Favorite Color**

- Now, since **Alice likes blue** and **Carol likes green**, the only color left is red.
- Therefore, **Bob must like red** (since Bob does not like blue according to clue 2).

**Conclusion: Assign Favorite Colors**
Now we can summarize the favorite colors based on our deductions:

- **Alice: blue**
- **Bob: red**
- **Carol: green**

Therefore, the solution is:

- Alice: blue
- Bob: red
- Carol: green
  Let's work through the logic puzzle step-by-step.

# immediate2

We have 4 people: A, B, C, and D, sitting in a row with the following constraints:

1. A is not next to B.
2. B is next to C.
3. C is not next to D.

Let's analyze the requirements:

1. **B must sit next to C.** This gives us two possibilities for pairs: BC or CB.
2. **A cannot sit next to B.** This condition needs to be considered once we establish positions for B and C.
3. **C cannot sit next to D.** This condition will further restrict our arrangements.

### Step 1: Arranging B and C together

Let's start with the pair BC:

- If we treat BC as a single unit (block), we have three "units" to arrange: BC, A, D.

Possible arrangements of these units (block BC considered as one) in a row:

- BCAD
- ADBC
- DABC

However, we need to confirm which of these arrangements meet all conditions.

#### Testing BCAD

- A is not next to B (Condition 1): **Satisfied**
- B is next to C (Condition 2): **Satisfied**
- C is not next to D (Condition 3): **Satisfied**

#### Testing ADBC

- A is not next to B (Condition 1): **Satisfied**
- B is next to C (Condition 2): **Satisfied**
- C is not next to D (Condition 3): **Not satisfied** (C is next to D)

#### Testing DABC

- A is not next to B (Condition 1): **Satisfied**
- B is next to C (Condition 2): **Satisfied**
- C is not next to D (Condition 3): **Satisfied**

From testing, we have the valid arrangements:

- BCAD
- DABC

### Step 2: Arranging CB

Next, let’s test the pair CB:

- If we treat CB as a single unit, we again have three units: CB, A, D.

Possible arrangements of these units:

- CBAD
- ADBC
- DACB

#### Testing CBAD

- A is not next to B (Condition 1): **Satisfied**
- B is next to C (Condition 2): **Satisfied**
- C is not next to D (Condition 3): **Satisfied**

#### Testing ADBC

- A is not next to B (Condition 1): **Satisfied**
- B is next to C (Condition 2): **Satisfied**
- C is not next to D (Condition 3): **Not satisfied** (C is next to D)

#### Testing DACB

- A is not next to B (Condition 1): **Satisfied**
- B is next to C (Condition 2): **Satisfied**
- C is not next to D (Condition 3): **Satisfied**

### Conclusion

After testing all feasible arrangements, we can conclude:

The possible seating arrangements are:

- **BCAD**
- **DABC**
- **CBAD**
- **DACB**

So the final answer considering all constraints and checking each arrangement step-by-step confirms:

- **Valid arrangements: BCAD, DABC, CBAD, DACB**.
